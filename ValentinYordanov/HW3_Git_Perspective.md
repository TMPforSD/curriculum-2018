### Clone project
The **clone project** option let's us clone a git repository to the dirigible workspace.

To clone a repository - put the repository's URL into the *URL* field. We put the credentials in the username and password fields.
**Note: If the repo is public - we can skip username and password.**

### Pull all projects
**Pull all projects** option is similar to the clone option, but it works for multiple repositories at once.

After we type the  username and password, it downloads all the repositories associated with the account.

### Push all projects
**Push all projects** gives us the option to commit and push all the changes with have made.

We can add commit message as well as our email. The username and password are needed for authentication.

### Console
