# Using Import View in Eclipse Dirigible

The **Import View** enables you to upload file/s, containing one or more projects, to selected workspace in **Eclipse Dirigible**.

## Prerequisites
- You must sign in Eclipse Dirigible as a guest or from your personal account.
- In order to use a project in Eclipse Dirigible you need to upload your project to a certain **workspace** as separate files or as a .zip archive using Import View.

## Import View options

The following table describes the available Import View options.  You may need to select more than one option in order to:

- Upload file/s to upload queue
- Remove file/s from upload queue
- Cancel certain file/s before successful upload
- Upload/Remove/Cancel all files
- Switch between workspaces

| **Option** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Import to workspace** | This option allows you to upload files to specified workspace and switch between multiple workspaces. |
| **Choose files** | Choose files option allows you to select files from your file system. |
