# Debugger Perspective in Eclipse Dirigible 
   In this documentation you will learn how to use the Debugger in Eclipse Dirigible.

The front-facing Web IDE component is a collection of plugins for project management, source code editing, modeling, SCM integration, database management and many more. The Debugger perspective enables you to monitor the execution of your code, stop it, restart it or set breakpoints, and change values in memory.
# Content
The Debugger perspective has five views:
   -	Debugger
   -	Variables
   -	Breakpoints
   -	Console
   -	Preview
# Debugger
The window of the Debugger looks like.

You can see them during the debugging process.

# Breakpoints view
The breakpoint view shows you the breakpoints that you have created and enables you to follow them during debugging.
The first column of the view displays the path to the file in the repository and the second one - the row where the breakpoint is put.
