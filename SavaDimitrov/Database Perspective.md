# Database PerspectiveThe Database perspective contains tools for inspection and manipulation of the artifacts within the underlying relational database. It is comprised of:1. Database view2. SQL view3. Result view4. Console viewThe Database perspective features a database explorer, a console to execute SQL statements and to preview results in table format.Overall view:![Database Perspective](http://www.dirigible.io/help/images/ide_perspective_database.png)You can easily control your actions while working with the database perspective, where every view has its own specific usage.### 1. Database viewThe Database view gives you direct access to the default target schema assigned to your account in the Web IDE. It enables you to expand the schema item and see the list of all tables and views created either via the data structures models or directly via SQL script.![Database view](http://www.dirigible.io/help/images/ide_view_database.png)It's easy to navigate yourself through the schema from the database view. As it is shown on the picture, from the expanding of the schema a list of all the tables appear. And all the columns of every table is also shown.### 2. SQL viewThe SQL view is one of the most powerful and dangerous tools for database management. In the SQL view you can enter the SQL script compliant to the underlying database system.![SQL view](http://www.dirigible.io/help/images/ide_view_sql.png)Also in this console you can write your scripts for creating database views, copying tables and filling them with information from the copied table, making user defined functions(UDF) and everything else that SQL language can do. And you get the result of the execution in the Results view below.### 3. Result viewIn the Result view you see the result of the executed SQL query. The query returns a table with a number of columns that's equal to the relation in the currently executed statement.It also shows you if there is a mistake in your statement.### 4. Console viewThe Console view is a major debugging tool. It displays the output that the execution of the code returned. With this tool, if your query returns an answer different from what you were expecting, you can follow what the debugger called(as function) while executing the code and find your mistake. Also, if your code gives an error, you can easily see where exactly the error is.![Console view](http://www.dirigible.io/help/images/ide_view_console.png)
