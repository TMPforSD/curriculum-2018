# Debugger Perspective
The front-facing Web IDE component is a collection of plugins for project management, source code editing, modeling, SCM integration, database management and many more. One of the most important perspectives tha Web IDE includes is the Debugger perspective. 
It enables you to monitor the execution of your code, stop it, restart it or set breakpoints, and change values in memory.
What is more the Debugger perspective is comprised of the following views:

- Debugger
- Variables
- Breakpoints
- Console
- Preview

## Debugger

This is what the window of the Debugger looks like.

## Variables View
The Variables view displays the defined values of the variables when the code is executed. During the debugging process they may be displayed step by step or all at once, depending on the existing breakpoints.

## Breakpoints View
The Breakpoints view enables you to follow the breakpoints you have created in the course of the debugging process.
A breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause. 
The first column of the view displays the path to the file in the document repository and the second one - the row where the breakpoint is situated.

## Console View
The Console view is a major debugging tool. It displays the output of the code that you are executing.
