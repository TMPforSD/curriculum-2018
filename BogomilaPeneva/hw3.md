# Debugger Perspective

# The Debugger perspective enables you to monitor the execution of your code, stop it, restart it or set breakpoints, and change values in memory.

The Web IDE includes a Debugger perspective which is comprised of the following views:

**Debugger view**

The Debugger view enables you to navigate the debugging of your code: to start it, pause it, restart it or proceed step by step.

**Variables**  **view**

The Variables view displays the defined values of the variables when the code is executed. During the debugging process they may be displayed step by step or all at once, depending on the existing breakpoints.

**Breakpoints view**

The Breakpoints view enables you to follow the breakpoints you have created in the course of the debugging process. The first column of the view displays the path to the file in the document repository and the second one - the row where the breakpoint is situated.

**Console view**

The Console view is a major debugging tool. It displays the output of the code that you are executing.

**Preview view**

The Preview view displays the result of executing the selected file. It refreshes automatically during Workspace change events e.g. Save.
