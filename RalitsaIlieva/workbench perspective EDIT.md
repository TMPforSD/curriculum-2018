**Workbench perspective** is the place where the user develops the dynamic applications. This perspective contains all *views* and *editors*(suitable for any file type) that may help in the overall implementation, from domain models via services to the user interface.

### Workbench perspective **views**:
-	Workspace
-	Import
-	Properties
-	Console
-	Preview

### Workspace

The main view opened by default in this perspective is the Workspace explorer, a *standard view* on the projects in your *workspace*.

The **Workspace** is the developerâ€™s place where user creates and manages the application artifacts. The first-level citizens of the *workspace* are the *projects*. Each project can contain multiple folders and files (artifacts).
A single user can have *multiple workspaces*, containing different set of projects.

### Import

The **Import view** enables the user to upload a *.zip file, containing one or more projects, to the selected Workspace. The view includes a progress bar for navigation of the process. The user can manage and switch between multiple workspaces through the Workspace menu.
